# NSGA [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/pawel-jakubowski/NSGA.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/pawel-jakubowski/NSGA)

Non-Dominated Sorting Algorithm as Bicriterial Optimization Method with constraints

## Goals
* Create application to solve bicriterial optimization problem with constraints (NSGA-II)
* Allow user to input two goal functions with up to 5 variables as string ('f(x1,x2,x3,x4,x5)')
* Allow user to define max. 5 constraints
* Plot set expression and Pareto-optimized solution vector
* (additionally) create GUI
