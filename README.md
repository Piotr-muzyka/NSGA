# NSGA
Non-Dominated Sorting Algorithm as Bicriterial Optimization Method with constraints

## Goals
* Create application to solve bicriterial optimization problem with constraints (NSGA-II)
* Allow user to input mathematical expressions (f(x1,x2)) as string
* Allow user to define max. 5 constraints
* Plot set expression and Pareto-optimized solution vector
* (additionally) create GUI
